# Bioinformatics Analysis P70922

## Directions 
BINF630/BIOL580/BINF401 Spring 2018. 
Homework 2. 
Due April 26, 2018.
Select one of the protein sequences from the list below (the first letter of the protein ID should be the same as the first letter of your last name or the closest to it). Predict secondary and three-dimensional structure for the selected sequence using an advanced secondary structure prediction algorithm and a homology modeling algorithm, respectively. Analyze the quality of your model using one of the structure validation or verification tools and identify structural classification of your model. 

[FOR BINF630 AND BIOL580 STUDENTS ONLY: Compare predicted secondary structures with the secondary structures in 3D model.]

Proteins: A3ZYW9,  D2R8U6,  E8VHH5,   F2B227,  H8FDZ3, G2LWL6,  K8G1J4,  P70922,  Q1N7D2,  Q1NN20,  Q5GY42,  U4M247,  Z4WQ39
 
Present the results of the modeling with description of all the steps and structure annotation in HTML format with interactive molecular visualization and alignment visualization tools and post the files on your binf webspace. Submit the URL by email with the string "b630_18_hw2" in the message subject line.

## Steps 

1. Protein Selected (P70922)
2. Secondary structure was predicted with [jpred](https://swissmodel.expasy.org/) an advanced secondary structure prediction algorithm
3. 3D structure was predicted with [swissmodel](https://swissmodel.expasy.org/), homology-modeling server
4. Quality of Model was analyzed with [swissmodel qmean](https://swissmodel.expasy.org/qmean/) 
5. html results and description presented in this repository
